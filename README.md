# MEAN App with Angular 2 and the Angular CLI

This project is based on tutorial [https://scotch.io/tutorials/mean-app-with-angular-2-and-the-angular-cli](https://scotch.io/tutorials/mean-app-with-angular-2-and-the-angular-cli).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Start API

Run `node server.js` -> API running on localhost:3000/api

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.
